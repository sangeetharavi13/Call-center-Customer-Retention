# Call-center-Customer-Retention

## About Project 👨‍💻

PhoneNow Call center Retention Manager has requested a dashboard that can generate informative data on Churn customers. 

## Problem Statement

The retention department wants to get customers back in case of termination. Currently, they get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary. They want to know in advance who is at risk.
